This repository is a personal guide to Data Structures and Algorithms.
Most of what you see here is me learning and practicing coding these in different languages, with some little insight to my understandings through the `datastructures-info.txt` txt files.
I will first understand and implement these structs using Python, before writing in other languages such as JavaScript, C++, and Rust.
